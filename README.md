# My website

This is the repo for my [website](https://grunkgrunk.github.io/my-website/). It is built using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and based on the work of [matfantinel](https://github.com/matfantinel). 

# Building & Running Locally

To run it locally, you simply have to run:

```shell
# First, install dependencies
npm install
# Then, run it on dev mode
npm run dev
```

The site should now be available at http://localhost:5173/ on your local machine, and your local machine's IP address on your networkâ€”great for testing on mobile OSes.
