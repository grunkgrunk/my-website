My friend [Jakob Schauser](https://www.linkedin.com/in/top-data-science/?trk=people_directory&originalSubdomain=dk) and I have been making games together since 2014. Jakob was the one who originally inspired me to start creating games after I watched him code different projects in GameMaker back in high school. That experience sparked my interest in coding, and eventually, game development became a shared passion for us.

We've participated in several game jams, including the [GMTK Game Jam](https://gamemakerstoolkit.com/jam/), [Ludum Dare](https://ludumdare.com/), and [Trijam](https://trijam.itch.io/). Game jams are time-constrained competitions where you develop a game based on a specific theme. They're a fantastic way to stay motivated and complete projects, and we always have a blast coming up with ideas and bringing them to life. The process is intense, but it's also incredibly cozy, often accompanied by late-night coding sessions, plenty of pizza, and the occasional walk to clear our minds.

We like creating our own assets, sound effects, and music for our projects. It a lot of fun and also just a great way to get a break from coding.

The first games we made were using [Love2D](https://www.love2d.org) and a combination of JavaScript canvas, CSS, and HTML. Later, we experimented with [Godot](https://www.godotengine.org) and [Unity](https://unity.com/). After trying both, we've primarily settled on Godot as our go-to engine.

So far, our games have been relatively small in scope, but weâ€™re planning to tackle something more ambitious soon. You can check out our work on our page on [itch.io](https://schrunkin.itch.io/).
