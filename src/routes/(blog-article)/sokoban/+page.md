Sometimes I want to make a game but my mind is completely out of ideas. In that case I sometimes settle on cloning an already existing game. This time I tried to replicate the Japanese game Sokoban from 1981. In this game you play as a person moving around in a grid and the goal is to push blocks into certain positions. This is what I ended up with.

If you want to play it or just want to check out the code, you can find it all [here](https://github.com/grunkgrunk/sokoban/tree/master). The game is written using the [Love2D](https://love2d.org/) framework.
